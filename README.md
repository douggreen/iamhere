# “I am Here” Communities

## Overview

**Mission:**  
The Community Home Dining Initiative aims to foster unity and understanding among diverse community groups by facilitating shared small group meals. The program is designed to help the community connect on a personal level, fostering relationships that transcend labels and preconceptions, allowing people to see each other as individuals. The program stresses curiosity over closed-mindedness.

**Inclusive Outreach with Intentional Leadership:**  
The heart of this program is to bring people together who might not otherwise come to the table. It is not only for those already seeking connection, but especially for those who are hesitant, isolated, or skeptical. Success depends on strong, intentional leadership from each participating community to extend invitations with compassion and persistence, helping individuals feel welcome and safe enough to say yes.

**Building Trust:**  
Trust is a foundation of this initiative, established through a structured referral system, safety measures, and clear community guidelines. See sections [Trust Through Ratings](#trust-through-ratings) and [Trust and Safety](#trust-and-safety).

**Organizational Support:**  
Built around communities and organizations, this program encourages people from various religious, civic, and educational organizations to connect on a personal level. While the idea starts in Winchester, Virginia with the Valley Interfaith Council (VIC), our aim is to create a replicable framework and technology for any community. See [How the Program is Organized](#how-the-program-is-organized).

**Focus on Social Connections:**  
This initiative centers on creating organic social connections through shared meals. Events are unstructured, with no agenda beyond connection. This is different from other meal-sharing programs that focus on structured dialogue.

**Name and Meaning:**  
The name “I am Here” comes from the Hebrew word *Hineni*. Hillel asked:  
> “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And being for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?”  
Our answer to this is *Hineni* — I am present, I show up, I am here.

## How the Program is Organized

The program is community-led and scalable with three key levels:

- **Communities:** Geographic areas (e.g., Winchester, Charlottesville) with a Community Organizer.
- **Organizations:** Local organizations (faith-based, civic, educational) that affiliate with the program.
- **Friends:** Individual participants who join through organizations or referrals. "IAH Friends" refers to these participants.
- **Growth:** Friends may invite personal friends (with Host approval) to become IAH Friends.
- **Supporting Restaurants:** Restaurants that support the vision by offering space for gatherings.

## Pilot Program

- **Initial Community:** Winchester, Virginia via the Valley Interfaith Council (VIC).
- **Expansion Targets:** Civic organizations (Kiwanis, Rotary, Lions, Civitan) and educational institutions (Shenandoah University, Laurel Ridge Community College).

## Hosts and Meal Events

- **Hosting:** IAH Friends can host meals in homes or supporting restaurants. They set the date, number of guests, and optional themes or food notes.
- **Event Notification:** Events are listed anonymously, and the system invites a diverse group of Friends.

---

## Trust Through Ratings

- **Mutual Ratings:** Guests and Hosts rate each other after events.
- **Public and Private Feedback:** Feedback may be shared publicly or privately with organizers.
- **Endorsements:** Friends may endorse each other, contributing to trustworthiness. Trusted Friends may earn "Good Friend" status.
