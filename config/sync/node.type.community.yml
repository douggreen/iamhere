description: 'Communities are geographic areas (e.g., Winchester, Charlottesville) where an "I am Here" (IAH) program is active. Communities should be small enough that you can run into someone at the local grocery store. So a Community in a large metropolitan area, should be limited to something manageable (Downtown Cincinnati, Norther Cincinnati, etc). Anyone can start a local IAH Community and become its Community Organizer.'
